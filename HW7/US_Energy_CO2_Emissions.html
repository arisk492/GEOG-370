<h1>Homework 7: Choropleth </h1>
<h2>Ari Kauftheil</h2>
<p>For this assignment I looked into carbon dioxide emissions in the United States and ended up making two choropleths. 
    The first choropleth shows carbon dioxide emissions per capita from energy production in each U.S. state.
The second choropleth shows the percent change in per capita carbon dioxide emissions from energy production from 1970 to 2019. 
I chose this topic because I was interested in learning about which parts of the U.S. have cleaner energy economies.</p>
